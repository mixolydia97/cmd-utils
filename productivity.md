### [Exercism](https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io)
Download exercises to work on in a bunch of programming languages. I really ought to 
use this more but I always forget.

### [MacVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim)
Technically a command line utility. Anyway, it's Vim but for Mac.

### [Micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro)
A great nano replacement that supports mouse usage. I used to love it more than Vim
but now that I'm becoming accustomed to Vim, I rarely use it unless I know I'll have 
to do a lot of cut/copy/paste within a file (sorry, Vim).

### [Ranger](http://ranger.nongnu.org/)
Finder-like file manager in the console

### [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) (aka "task")
Haven't started using this yet but it's supposed to be a todo list
__EDIT:__ I am actually quite enjoying TaskWarrior. It's simplistic enough to not be
annoying. At launch of a new iTerm session, I have my tasks listed so I'm less likely
to forget. The only real issue is being unable to specify the urgency of tasks. Tasks
become more urgent the longer they remain undone but I would prefer to set the urgency
when I make the task.

### [Tidy-HTML5](http://www.html-tidy.org/)
Pretty sure I have this installed for Atom and the HTML linter there
